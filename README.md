# Life Table Reconstruction model

This model uses life table reconstructions to calculate survival-at-age and fecundity-at-age over time from the available data series, and applied the Euler-Lotka equation to estimate the corresponding population growth rate ($\lambda$)  in a given year. This allowed us to use information on births, deaths and maturity to describe each stockâ€™s demographics and how they changed over age and over time using a tractable and consistent model, despite variability among stock assessments.
